/-----ON DIALOGUE SYSTEM-----\

FUNCTIONS
I currently have it set up so functions will ONLY run when NPCs talk. They do not run when the player talks.If I want to run something from there in the future, I will need to modify the code.

Functions are called AFTER a dialogue node is DISMISSED and as the next one comes on! If you want to call a function BEFORE a dialogue box appears, it needs to be called in the code for the node prior to it. I can look into updating this later if I need to.
