FUNCTIONS

On Function Timing
Functions are called AFTER a dialogue node is DISMISSED and as the next one comes on! If you want to call a function BEFORE a dialogue box appears, it needs to be called in the code for the node prior to it. I can look into updating this later if I need to.

On Function Parameters
If you want to pass MULTIPLE PARAMETERS through a function, you need to pass them as an array. s
